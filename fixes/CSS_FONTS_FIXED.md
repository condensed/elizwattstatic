# FIXED: CSS Font Paths

## Issue Found
The browser console was showing:
```
GET http://wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.woff net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
GET http://wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.ttf net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

## Root Cause
The `fix_paths.py` script only fixed **HTML files**, not **CSS files**. The CSS file (`wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css`) contained protocol-relative URLs like:

```css
src: url("//wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.woff");
```

The browser interpreted `//wp-content/` as a domain name, not a file path.

## Solution Applied
Fixed all font URLs in the CSS file to use paths relative to the CSS file's location:

### Before:
```css
src: url("//wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.eot");
src: url("//wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/311FEC_0_0.eot");
```

### After:
```css
src: url("fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.eot");
src: url("fonts/311FEC_0_0.eot");
```

## Files Fixed
- `/wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css`
  - Fixed SangBleuKingdom font paths (lines 814, 816)
  - Fixed 311FEC font paths (lines 616, 617)
  - Fixed condensed_base-icon font path (line 621)

## How CSS Paths Work
CSS files use paths relative to **the CSS file's location**, not the HTML file:

- CSS file location: `/wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css`
- Font files location: `/wp-content/themes/watt-scb/fonts/`
- Correct path from CSS: `fonts/SangBleuKingdom-Medium-WebM.woff`

## Test Now
Reload the page at `http://localhost:8000/thoughts/page/2/` and:

1. ✅ The page should now have proper fonts loaded
2. ✅ No more `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors in console
3. ✅ All styling should be correct

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All paths are now fixed in both HTML and CSS files!

The site is ready for GitHub Pages deployment.
