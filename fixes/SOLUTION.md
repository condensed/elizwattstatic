# SOLUTION: Assets Not Loading

## The Problem

The HTTP server is not running on port 8000. Without a running server, the page cannot load properly.

## The Fix

1. **Start the HTTP server:**

```bash
cd /Users/shaunsantacruz/Downloads/simply-static-1-1761684244
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

You should see:
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
```

2. **Open your browser and visit:**

```
http://localhost:8000/thoughts/page/2/
```

**Important:** DO NOT open the file directly by:
- Double-clicking index.html
- Using File → Open in browser
- Using `file:///` URLs

## Verification

After starting the server, all these should work:

- ✅ `http://localhost:8000/` - Homepage
- ✅ `http://localhost:8000/thoughts/` - Thoughts page 1
- ✅ `http://localhost:8000/thoughts/page/2/` - Thoughts page 2 (with styling)
- ✅ `http://localhost:8000/about/` - About page

## Why the Paths ARE Correct

The paths in your HTML files are **already fixed and correct**:

```html
<!-- From /thoughts/page/2/index.html -->
<link href="../../../wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

This path works because:
- Current location: `/thoughts/page/2/`
- `../` goes to `/thoughts/page/`
- `../` again goes to `/thoughts/`
- `../` again goes to `/` (root)
- Then adds `wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css`
- Final: `/wp-content/themes/watt-scb/style.css` ✅

## Test Results

All tests pass:
- ✅ Files exist
- ✅ Paths use correct `../../../` format  
- ✅ Ready for HTTP server
- ❌ Server just needs to be started

## Next Steps

1. Start the server (command above)
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/thoughts/page/2/`
3. Page should now load with full styling
4. All navigation links should work

**Status:** Ready to deploy! Just need to run the HTTP server.
