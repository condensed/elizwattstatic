# Category Dropdown Fixed ✅

## Issue
Category dropdown on `/thoughts/` (and other pages) was loading `about:blank#blocked` instead of navigating to category pages like `/category/change/`.

## Root Cause
The WordPress category dropdown was using:
1. **Form action:** `action="//"` (protocol-relative URL)
2. **Category IDs:** `value="28"` instead of URLs
3. **Form submission:** Trying to submit to non-existent WordPress backend

## Solution Applied

### Changed Form Behavior
**Before:**
```html
<form action="//" method="get">
<select onchange="return this.form.submit()">
<option value="28">Change</option>
```

**After:**
```html
<form action="#" method="get" onsubmit="return false;">
<select onchange="if(this.value && this.value !== '-1') window.location.href = this.value;">
<option value="../category/change/">Change</option>
```

### What Changed
1. ✅ Form action: `/` → `#` (prevents submission)
2. ✅ Form onsubmit: Added `return false` to prevent submission
3. ✅ Select onchange: Changed from form submit to JavaScript redirect
4. ✅ Option values: Category IDs → Direct URLs with correct relative paths
5. ✅ Path calculation: Automatically adjusts based on file depth

## Files Fixed
All pages with category dropdowns including:
- `/thoughts/index.html`
- All category pages (`/category/*/index.html`)
- Category pagination pages (`/category/*/page/*/index.html`)

## How It Works Now
1. User selects a category from dropdown
2. JavaScript checks if value is valid (not -1)
3. Browser redirects to the category URL
4. Relative paths work from any page depth

## Test It
Visit: `http://localhost:8000/thoughts/`

1. Click the "Thoughts by Category" dropdown
2. Select "Change"  
3. Should navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/category/change/`
4. ✅ Works!

## Category Mappings
- Beauty → `/category/beauty-2/`
- Change → `/category/change/`
- Conscious Living → `/category/conscious-living/`
- Creativity → `/category/creativity/`

- Photography → `/category/photography/`
- Productivity → `/category/productivity/`
- Projects → `/category/projects/`
- Seeing → `/category/seeing/`
- The Brain → `/category/the-brain/`

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Category dropdowns now work correctly on all pages!
