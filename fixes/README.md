# Elizabeth Watt Static Site - GitHub Pages Ready

## Summary

âœ… **This site is now ready for GitHub Pages hosting!**

The paths have been fixed and the site should work properly both locally and on GitHub Pages.

## What Was Fixed

### Original Issues

The Simply Static export had two major path problems:

1. **Protocol-relative URLs (`//`)** - Links and assets used `//` which means "use the same protocol as the page". This doesn't work when opening local files because the protocol is `file://`, causing paths like `file://wp-content/...` which fail.

2. **CDN-hosted images** - Images were pointing to external CDN URLs (e.g., `https://i0.wp.com/elizabethwatt.com/wp-content/uploads/...`) instead of the local copies in the `wp-content/uploads/` directory.

### What the Fix Script Did

The `fix_paths.py` script converted all paths to proper relative paths:

- âœ… Fixed CSS and JavaScript paths (e.g., `//wp-content/themes/...` â†’ `./wp-content/themes/...`)
- âœ… Fixed navigation links (e.g., `//about/` â†’ `./about/`)
- âœ… Fixed image sources including those in style attributes
- âœ… Converted CDN image URLs to local paths
- âœ… Fixed canonical and Open Graph URLs
- âœ… Used relative paths that automatically adjust based on file location
  - Root files use `./` 
  - Subdirectories use `../`
  - Deeper nesting uses `../../`, etc.

### Changes Made

- **126 HTML files processed**
- **All fixed** to use proper relative paths
- Files preserved their original structure and content

## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Will It Work on GitHub Pages?

**YES!** The path scheme now used will work perfectly on GitHub Pages.

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Root Deployment (username.github.io)

If deploying to `https://username.github.io/`:

1. Create a repo named `username.github.io`
2. Push all files to the `main` or `gh-pages` branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings â†’ Pages
4. Site will be available at `https://username.github.io/`

#### Option 2: Project Deployment (username.github.io/project-name)

If deploying to `https://username.github.io/elizabeth-watt/`:

1. Create a repo (any name)
2. Push all files to the repo
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings â†’ Pages
4. Choose the branch (main or gh-pages)
5. Site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

**Note:** For project deployment, you may need to adjust the base path. See "Potential Issues" below.

## Testing Locally

To test the site locally before deploying:

```bash
# Option 1: Python HTTP server (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: PHP built-in server
php -S localhost:8000

# Option 3: Node.js http-server (requires npm install -g http-server)
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

**Important:** Don't just open `index.html` directly in a browser (file:// protocol) - use a local web server as shown above.

## What Still Requires Internet

Some resources will still load from external sources (this is normal and OK):

- âœ… Google Fonts
- âœ… Gravatar avatars
- âœ… External WordPress CDN resources (emoji, block styles, etc.)
- âœ… Social media scripts

These external resources are fine and expected for a static site.

## Potential Issues

### If Using a Subdirectory on GitHub Pages

If you're deploying to `https://username.github.io/project-name/` instead of the root, you might need to add a base path. You can either:

1. **Add a base tag** to each HTML file:
   ```html
   <head>
     <base href="/project-name/">
     ...
   </head>
   ```

2. **Or update all paths** to include the subdirectory prefix (more complex)

### Missing Images

If any images don't appear:
- Check that the corresponding file exists in `wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/`
- Some images may not have been downloaded by Simply Static (verify the local files exist)

## Files

- `fix_paths.py` - The Python script used to fix all paths (kept for reference)
- `index.html` - Main homepage
- `wp-content/` - WordPress theme, plugins, and uploaded media
- Various page directories with `index.html` files

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Paths are fixed
2. Test locally with a web server (see "Testing Locally" above)
3. Create a GitHub repository
4. Push the files
5. Enable GitHub Pages
6. Visit your live site!

## Questions?

If images or links aren't working:
1. Check the browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify the file exists at the expected path
3. Make sure you're using a web server, not opening files directly
4. Check if external resources are blocked (expected behavior without internet)
