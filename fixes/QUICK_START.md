git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

## 🔗 Your Site URL

**Root deployment:** `https://username.github.io/`

**Project deployment:** `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

*(If project deployment links don't work, see README.md for base tag fix)*

## 🧪 Test Locally First (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/shaunsantacruz/Downloads/simply-static-1-1761684244
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open: `http://localhost:8000/`

Check that:
- [ ] Homepage displays correctly
- [ ] CSS styles load
- [ ] Images appear
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Internal links work

## 📋 What Was Fixed

✅ Protocol-relative URLs (`//`) → Relative paths (`./` or `../`)

✅ Navigation links → Relative paths
✅ CSS/JS references → Relative paths
✅ Style attribute URLs → Relative paths

**Total: 126 HTML files processed and fixed**
